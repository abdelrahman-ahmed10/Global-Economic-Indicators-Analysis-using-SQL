# Global-Economic-Indicators-Analysis-using-SQL
The goal of this project was to explore, analyze, and compare economic indicators using SQL by applying filtering, aggregation, and data validation techniques. It also demonstrated how relational databases connect multiple tables through JOIN operations to retrieve structured and meaningful insights instead of working with isolated data.
